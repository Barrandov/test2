2	Lee P	I am a native speaker and conversation tutor, providing private English conversation lessons using something called Life Learning.This method allows students to take complete control of how and what they learn. It is student-led learning focusing on interests, life goals, enjoyment and effective learning for you, as an individual.Stop wasting time with textbooks, tests and unneccesary pressure. Find a love for learning and speaking English with creativity and freedom. The lessons are completely chosen by you to keep you motivated and driven to achieve your goals.	4.8	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=19	1200
3	Felix A	The English language has become the language of the world, thus, it is considered a world language. Today English seems to evolve to a future global tongue, as its spreading on the Internet in recent years shows (almost 80% of the worldwide web's pages are now written in English). scientific researchers have found out that in fact many small languages have already vanished.But to teach it in a satisfactory manner a good teacher of English is required.xA good teacher of English must possess some qualities.Business, General and conversational English	4.7	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=27	1300
4	Milan S	I have a wide range of interests, believe me, you will never be bored during our lesson. I worked with lawyers, doctors, biologists and many others to help them improve their English in their respective fields. Since I spent my whole life satisfying my curiosity, I acquired a huge vocabulary that I can pass on to you.	4.9	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=28	1300
5	Gulya S	Hello! My name is Gulya :) I am a native speaker of the Russian language and I am fluent in English. I have been teaching online for 3 years now. I have an individual program, having studied your requirements, I am preparing a special program. plan, and therefore deal) Books Cambridge, Oxford, etc. I train and develop colloquial speech. We study words, stable combinations and put them into practice. We speak and try to speak :) on different topics. We listen to audio lessons, watch films with subtitles. We analyze everything on the shelves :) In parallel, of course, we study the basics of grammar and the correct delivery of sentences :) All the materials are provided by me. I promise you that you will talk from the first first lesson :)	4.3	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=29	900
6	Yan M	Hello! My name is Yang and for more than five years I have been teaching English. I spent part of this time in China, where I worked with students from 3 to 40 years old. I deal with both adults and children. But for all ages, I try to make my classes fun and interactive. Teaching English to me is not just a language lesson. I always try to attract a wider cultural and historical context that helps my students understand more about the language and its features. A degree in history helps me a lot to create such an intellectual environment in the classroom.For each student, I develop an individual curriculum that depends on its goals and needs.	3.9	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=30	800
7	Eran E	Hello, my name is Eran & I am a friendly native English speaker. I am an experienced English teacher with a neutral accent that is easily understood. This is because I have grown up living in 13 countries across 4 continents. They include England, America, Australia & Japan. Presently, I live in Lisbon, Portugal. While I am primarily focused on 1 to 1 tuition, I‚Äôve previously taught classes with as many as 50 students at a time. My students have ranged from 12 to 70 years old. From Israeli middle schoolers all the way through to Thai Government officials. As a result, I‚Äôve learned a wide variety of teaching methods. Currently, I'm taking students with English level: B2 onwards, as well as those who are interested in long-term growth and multiple lessons.I understand how hard it can be to learn another language. That's why my teaching style is fun, constructive & easy-going. Lessons will be tailored to meet your needs & goals. Through my lessons, you will gain the confidence to speak English in your daily life.	4.5	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=32	1200
8	Mr. Mark	My lessons are fun and practical, but most importantly, we are going to be extremely productive. I believe that the best way to master English is through EXECUTION. Less theory, more practice. Lots of practice. Our goal is to achieve maximum involvement and focus on the subject. Schools trained us to be very passive. Sit quietly by yourself, be lectured to, just consume information. THAT is not how we are going to learn English.	4.5	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=33	1100
9	Skye L.	Hello, My name is Skye. I‚Äôm from London in the United Kingdom but I am currently living in Japan. I have a TEFL certificate which I acquired last year. Since moving to Japan I have been teaching some of my Japanese friends English. I think learning should be fun and engaging and even though English can be difficult to learn I aim to make it enjoyable.I enjoy watching football and travelling. I do a lot of Yoga in my spare time and I can't wait to meet you!	5	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=35	1700
10	Seeta Y.	Hello and welcome to my profile learners of the wonderful world of the English language! I am a certified native English teacher with an A in TEFL. Learning something new should be fun and exciting and not something you‚Äôre dragging your feet into doing which is why I believe a little fun and humour plays a huge part in the learning process and also the development of a healthy and enjoyable relationship between us.I am also currently trying to learn a new language and so I know from my own experience how daunting or sometimes challenging it can be but please remember I‚Äôm here to work with you and not against you. We can work together on pronunciation, reading, conversational English, homework you may have from school or college, slang, in fact on any subject area you enjoy or want to develop as when you‚Äôre enjoying the learning process you‚Äôre learning without even realising.	4.1	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=36	1200
11	Salman S	I motivate and guide students to achieve their goals. It depends on what is the problem they are facing. Sometimes they just want to practice speaking to improve their fluency. Sometimes it's more complicated which is a language barrier and I need to boost their confidence. Some are coming with a specific task to pass an exam like IELTS and TOEFL. Moreover some are seeking to improve their business skills and business conversation. Sometimes they need to pass the interview in English. According to their requirements I have materials and programs to help them to achieve their desired goals. My vast experience of teaching plays a vital role as well.	4.7	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=37	1100
12	Andrew G	Hi guys, My name is Andrew and I am an English teacher from the USA currently living now in Atlanta, Georgia.My teaching experience ranges from 1 on 1 to groups, children to adults, in-person or online. IMPORTANT*** Although I have experience teaching Children, right now I'm only teaching Adults through Conversational English. This is my specialty and I do this through focusing mainly on Accent Reduction, Pronunciation, Speech Therapy, and improving one's Vocabulary.I have been traveling and teaching since 2008 and my travels have really helped me be more culturally aware, and relevant. I am fun and unique when it comes to teaching English, you won't that find my classes anywhere else.	4.2	https://i.pravatar.cc/300?img=38	900
